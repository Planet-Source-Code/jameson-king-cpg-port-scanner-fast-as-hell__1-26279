## CPG Port Scanner\! \(Fast as Hell\)


</div>

### Description

This is by far the fastest port scanner I've ever used and/or made. Check this... It can scan 5,000 ports in one minute and one second. that's almost 82 ports a second. Now its written in VB, So out there someone some of you have seen better (maybe?) but I doubt it was written in VB and using a 56k line. In any case please check this out and tell me what you think of the method.
